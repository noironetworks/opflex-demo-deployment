# GCP GKE Cluster with ACI CNI
**A one step approach to setup GCP GKE cluster with ACI CNI**

1. Prerequisites (You will be prompted for GCP service account credential file, project name and region during bringup)
    1. A valid GCP account
    2. service account json key file (Download it from your GCP service account page )
    3. region to setup your GKE cluster (E.g. us-west1-b)
    4. gcloud installation
    5. python2.7/python3.6 along with pip
    6. virtualenv
2. clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/noironetworks/opflex-demo-deployment.git
```
3. Bringup the cluster
```
cd opflex-demo-deployment/k8s-gcp-gke
./gke up
```
4. Destroy the cluster
```
./gke destroy
```

N.B. To provide new credentials or region, delete the autogenerated .gkerc file and re-run
