# AWS EKS Cluster with ACI CNI
**A one step approach to setup AWS EKS cluster with ACI CNI**

1. Prerequisites (You will be prompted for AWS keys and region during bringup)
    1. A valid AWS account
    2. aws_access_key_id
    3. aws_secret_access_key
    4. An existing AWS VPC id (E.g vpc-001abcd1234efgh12) and its CIDR (E.g format A.B.C.D/X).
       The k8s cluster will be using 3 subnets A.B.101.0/24, A.B.102.0/24 and A.B.103.0/24
    5. python2.7/python3.6 along with pip
    4. virtualenv
2. clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/noironetworks/opflex-demo-deployment.git
```
3. Bringup the cluster
```
cd opflex-demo-deployment/k8s-aws-eks-byov
./eks up
```
4. Destroy the cluster
```
./eks destroy
```

N.B. To provide new credentials or region, delete the autogenerated .eksrc file and re-run
